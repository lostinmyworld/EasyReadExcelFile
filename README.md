# EasyReadExcelFile
Read Excel files for any format (currently for .xlsx, .xls, .xlsm, .csv, .xlsb (well. not quite...)).

It is a .NET Core console app written in C# using ExcelDataReader https://github.com/ExcelDataReader/ExcelDataReader nuget package.

It reads from the included Excel files and writes in console all the data just to see how to access them and what it reads.
